## Description

Given an integer n, return a string answer where:

- answer == "FizzBuzz" if i is divisible by 3 and 5.
- answer == "Fizz" if i is divisible by 3.
- answer == "Buzz" if i is divisible by 5.
- answer == i (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.

**Example:**

Example 1:
Input: n = 3
Output: "Fizz"

Example 2:
Input: n = 5
Output: "Buzz"

Example 3:
Input: n = 7
Output: "7"

Example 4:
